# PHP-CRUD-To-Do-List
Here I made a PHP-CRUD which is linked to mysqli database. I made it as a TO-DO list.
User can add records, read them and if they don't like, they can delete that record too.
Alos users can update the data. 
If record is deleted by users, it will be delete from database as well.
